            In this project we had to make a website for a fictional cinema chain in the Netherlands. My role in the project was to make the wireframe. I made a rough wireframe that was good enough, but I wanted to make it better. I am an avid
            cinema-goer, and I love movies. So I gave it an easy, minimalistic yet original design. I also had to come up with new user experience solutions that would make the cinema experience more social. But those I canâ€™t share here. Maybe if we
            work together, someday.

          <h2>The Trippy Kaleidoscope 2</h2>
          <p>
            What you see, next to you is a trippy program build by Processing. The program reacts to the positions of the mouse on the screen and move the wheels of the kaleidoscope according to it. For the course Programming Bootcamp we had to make
            a lot of small interactive codes. For the last day, we had to make a sketch that would use all the knowledge of the past 4 days. So, I came up with the Trippy Kaleidoscope. I learnt a lot about programming and how creative it could be. I
            happy to share my technicality and creativity in future projects.

          <h2>Website Design: Gift Crowdfunder</h2>
          <p>
            In my bachelor we had to design websites for business ideas that seem out of this world. For this project we had to design a website that was a part of online gift experience. The gift experience is meant to be given online to friends
            and family that are far away from each other. The website here beside incorporates weird but fun UX elements that were only possible by doing good research on the user we were given in the project. We had to make various user profiles,
            do interviews and really connect with the user in this project. I acquired skills that I know will come in handy one day.

          <h2> Research For Design</h2>
          <p>
            <p>In the interview, you have me in the blue shirt and one of the interviewee. For this project, we had to work in a group and research the user experience of a website. The website in question was, <a href="http://rijksmuseum.nl">rijksmuseum.nl</a>
              . The site was had a new section, in which users could create an account and save their favourite pieces of art. This was easier said than done. In the project we learned the value of honest and untainted research. We had to meticulous
              not to influence the subjects in the experiments. I made me realise how simple sites are taken for granted. I learned what could make or break a website.</p>
