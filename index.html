          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <h3> From Past to Present</h3>
          <p>My life begins on a cold Thursday night in the middle of January in the year 1998, in a small town called Rozenburg, I was born in a small apartment of my parents. Rozenburg was a small town with a small population, lots of nature, and
            lots of canals and dams. I remember nothing from that place, because we moved to Rotterdam when I was two years old. Specifically the south of Rotterdam, would be the place where I would grow up. But let's skip to the good part, middle
            school.</p>
          <p>When I now look back on my middle school experience I really miss it, even though it was hard work all day, every day. Middle school would be the place for me where I learned about science and the beauty that came with it. The first 3
            years of school, the classes we had we&rsquo;re regulated by the school, but at the end of the third year we could choose our own classes. I choose predominately the scientific classes. I had physics, chemistry, biology, math type B and
            math type D. The subjects weren&rsquo;t easy, the test were a pain in the butt, however the feeling of finally understanding it and passing the test is indescribable. This part of my life would also be where I discovered my hobbies and
            interests. One of my main hobbies is fitness. I started doing strength-training in the small gym of my school. If I had free time in between classes, you would find me there. I learned everything there was to learn about hypertrophy (the
            science behind growing muscle) and dieting. Eventually I got a gym subscription. An other hobby of mine that also started then, was making music. I have to thank my friend who introduced me to the technical part of editing tracks and
            recording. We would make some weird music, that didn&rsquo;t sound good at first, but we kept working on it. I still do some light remixing in my free time.</p>
          <p>After I graduated, I thought that a computer science bachelor would be the right pick for me. That turned not to be true. Although I share a great interest in the technical process of software, I felt out of place in that bachelor.
            Although the classes were interesting, the creativity and application of the theory was lacking. So I started looking for bachelors that combined the technical with the creative. After a long search I finally found the bachelor UXD. A
            term that I had vaguely heard before and new nothing more than only its name. I was intrigued, so I did some research on my own. I saw that UXD was connected to almost everything of the multi-media design process. I knew that this would
            ensure the possibility of working both creatively and technically. So, I decided to go to the open day and get a closer look. The open day confirmed my expectations and I finally enrolled myself.</p>
