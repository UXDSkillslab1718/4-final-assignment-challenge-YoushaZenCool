          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>The User Experience (UX) Design course explores two fundamental questions:<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <ol>
            <li>How does a user experience a digital product or service?</li>
            <li>How can we design the best possible experience for them while meeting wider business objectives?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>My user experience design skills</h3>
          <p>With a focus on design led by the psychology of user-needs, data gathering and analysis, the course taught me how to apply principles of cognitive science and computer programming to develop innovative and effective design solutions.</p>
          <p>I discovered how UX designers gathered data through ethnographic research and combine these insights with other data sources such as website statistics and industry trends. I learned how to analyse and apply that data to devise and
            refine a digital experience that works best in any given situation.</p>

          <h3>My user experience design future</h3>
          <p>Throughout my degree my learning oriented around the application of user experience design principles in support of successful business models. I used industry standard techniques to develop professional solutions for a range of
            contexts; in each case moving from research to the creation of user journeys to the design of user experience design that works across multiple digital environments.</p>
          <p>I learned how to work with the commercial sector through contact with businesses via live briefs and a student-led consultancy, developing project management, communication and collaborative working skills that will make your CV stand
            out to employers.</p>
