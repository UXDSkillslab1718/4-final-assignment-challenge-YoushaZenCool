          <h2>Determinator 9000: HAL</h2>
          <p>This project was the most fun and inspiring one I had ever done in my life. The goal of this project was to design a product video. The emphasis in this project played on: <strong>emotion</strong>. Before we even thought a possible
            product, we research on the relation between emotion and users. We looked at how products convey emotions. We looked at how we could use emotions in a non-traditional way to create a better user experience.</p>
          <p>The video, next to you, is the beginning of the product video. The product is called Determinator 9000: HAL. The editing and the effects were entirely made by me. I hope that gives some insights on my graphical skills.</p>

          <p>
            In this project we had to come up various ways to understand the journey a user takes. The story arc of the product was very important and how it related to the emotional state of the user. We used various experiments to first see the
            emotion of the user. Then we looked how we could possibly manipulate that. We used sound, sight and smell, to enhance the user experience but also the overall emotional state. Here you see one of the graphs that were made.

          <h3> Write about your work experience</h3>
          <p>
            <p>Through the process of diverging, the final product was created. To create a product that will help users with motivation and procrastination problems, who also want to start exercising again. The aim is to create a virtual assistant
              that will help with motivation and play with users emotions (playfully forceful) in order to help them in achieving their goal of being more active and fit. The user needs to get acquire good habits because the habits a person has
              determines the overall emotional state of a person.The user needs to receive instructions and explanation because when the user understand why he does it, they will add meaning and value to the task.The user needs to get positive
              encouragement because it pushes them to finish the task they started.We want to create an experience where the user gets pushed to do the things they know is good for them. However there are also parts that are fun, filled with humour
              and sarcasm. For the user we want to achieve a state of autonomy. The goal is that the AI fades out, when the good habits have manifested, and the bad habits have disintegrated.</p>

          <p>
            Although It may not be relevant, I wanted to make clear that if the opportunity presents it self, I can and will act. For this project I had to act as the main character, Mark. I know there arenâ€™t much acting gigs for UX designers, I am
            a jack of all trades.
